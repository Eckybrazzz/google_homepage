# google_homepage
This a recreation of the google homepage.

This is made for educational purposes. The logo and other resources that I might use in this project belong to Google Inc.

My goals with this project are:

    > Practice HTML
    > Practice CSS
    > Practice GIT and GitHub commands
   
Probably no-one but me will ever read this, but in case you are reading it, thank you. If you have any kind of feedback let me know.
